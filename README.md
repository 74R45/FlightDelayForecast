This project analyses airline flights data and builds a machine learning model to predict flight delays.
To perform data processing **Scala** and **Apache Spark** was used, and to perform data analysis the **Evilplot** library was used.
Machine learning was done using the Spark ML library.
The data used is **Airline On-Time Performance Data** from January 2019 (pre-COVID), which is available on the website of **Bureau of Transportation Statistics**.
